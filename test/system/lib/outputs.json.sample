# The following JSON represents the output generated by cloudformation/serverless upon deployment
# to the cloud. This gives us the ability to run system tests as part of the build or on a
# developer machine if you can acquire the correct endpoint URL. This file and the config.js
# file should be examined when executing system tests.

# To being running system tests locally copy the following JSON into outputs.json within the
# test/aws/ directory, update the ServiceEndpoint url and then examine config.js for correctness.
